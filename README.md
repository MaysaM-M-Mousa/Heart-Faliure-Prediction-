It's the final project for the creative inquiry hosted by `Clemson University, USA`. We remotely participated in as one of two groups of students presenting `An-Najah National University`.

Our program was about `Machine Learning` and we studied throughout the semester, had weekly zoom meetings with our PhD student supervisor from Clemson Unversity, and coded this project as the final project for this creative inquiry.

We chose [Heart Failure](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction?fbclid=IwAR2h0br-991xvOZsxTnG82tAQSHWD1Hqwmx9AUeJuoXBxiDA8xPfpFEBXOo) to be our dataset we are going to work with in our project.

For this project, we built different machine learning algorithms:
  * Logistic Regression
  * KNN
  * SVM
  * Random Forest
